✨ <h2>Core Features </h2>

<h3>🧠 AI Stylist (Flagship Feature)</h3>
A smart stylist powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash that understands natural language like:
“I need a cream dress for a wedding under 12,000 with a minimal look.”
The AI extracts:
Category (dress, shoes, bag)
Color
Occasion
Budget
Style
It then recommends a complete outfit (dress + shoes + bag) from the shop’s database , with a friendly explanation message.
This turns basic browsing into an interactive styling experience.
